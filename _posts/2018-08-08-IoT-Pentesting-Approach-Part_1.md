Hello everyone ,

Many Of you having a question how to start pentesting the IoT’s ,

With My experience I’m writing an approach Pentesting IoT’s

**Pentesting Surfaces**:

1. Network
2. Application Web, iOS, Android
3. wireless communication
4. Firmware
5. Hardware

**Network**: An IoT environment runs on and is updated over a network, such as the Internet, MQTT, 802.11.15.4, etc others.

**Applications**: IoT applications manage device- Web App, Mobile App,, and they can be web apps, mobile apps, or APIs (SOAP, REST – Web services).

**Wireless communication**: BLE, 4G, LTE, Zigbee, LoRA, WiFi

**Firmware**: This is the device’s software and operating system.

**Hardware**: This is the IoT device hardware (Chip, such as a chip set, Storage, JTAG, UART, Spi And I2C ports, Sensors, Camera etc.

**Testing Approach**:

**Network**:

1. Open Ports
2. Checking the Versions off running services
3. insecure communications

**Applications**:

1. front-end web
2. back-end web
3. iOS app
4. Android App
5. Web services

**Wireless Communication**:

1. PenTesting BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
2. PenTesting Zigbee
3. PenTesting Zwave
4. PenTesting WiFi (Wireless Fidelity)
5. PenTesting Lo-Ra
6. PenTesting 4G

**Firmware**:

1. checking hard coded data
2. pull out file system and analyzing
3. sensitive data identification
4. checking encryption
5. backdoor
6. API tokens & End Points
7. reverse engineering

**Hardware**:

1. Identifying the pins like JTAG, Spi, UART, I2C
2. Pulling firmware from the hardware
3. shell access with open pins
4. dechipping attack
5. USB Attacking
